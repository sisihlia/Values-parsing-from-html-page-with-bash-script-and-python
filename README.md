# Values-parsing-from-html-page-with-bash-script-and-python

The goal is to extract the specific header from http response and prices offered by "voyage-carrefour" website with destination Spain.
The source is html page that is parsed with both bash and python script.
Bash script calls curl command to get the page content and sed to extract the value.
Python script simply uses BeautifulSoap library to manipulate the data.
